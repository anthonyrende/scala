/*
Implicit Classes

Implicit classes allow implicit conversations with class's primary constructor
when the class is in scope. Implicit class is a class marked with 'implicit' keyword.

    Syntax −
    The following is the syntax for implicit classes.
    Here implicit class is always in the object scope
    where all method definitions are allowed because
    implicit class cannot be a top level class.

    object <object name> {
        implicit class <class name>(<Variable>: Datatype) {
            def <method>(): Unit =
        }
    }

    −Implicit classes must be defined inside another class/object/trait (not in top level).
    −Implicit classes may only take one non −implicit argument in their constructor.
    −Implicit classes may not be any method, member or object in scope with the same name as the implicit class.
