 Singleton Objects
 
 Scala is more object-oriented than Java because in Scala, we cannot have static members**. 
 Instead, Scala has singleton objects. A singleton is a class that can have only one instance, 
 i.e., Object. You create singleton using the keyword object instead of class keyword. 
 Since you can't instantiate a singleton object, you can't pass parameters to the primary constructor. 
 (All the examples using singleton objects where you called Scala's main method)

 **Static Members definiton -- https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26137/static-members
    Static members are data members (variables) or methods that belong to a static or a 
    non static class itself, rather than to objects of the class. Static members always remain the same, 
    regardless of where and how they are used. Because static members are associated with the class, 
    it is not necessary to create an instance of that class to invoke them.
